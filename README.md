What's On Your Plate? — Navigation Prototype

Option Chosen:
Option B: Single-Page Sections (Show/Hide)

I chose the single-page “show/hide” approach because my project’s content (Home, Recipes, and Diary) is closely related. This structure allows users to stay on one page while navigating between sections, making the experience smoother and faster without full page reloads. It also keeps my code simpler, since I only need one HTML file.

Sections:
Home – Introduces the site and invites users to start exploring recipes via a search bar. 
Recipes – Displays recipe results in card form with images, descriptions, and buttons.
Diary – Shows saved or favorite recipes added by the user as well as reflections and other prompts users can respond to. 

Navigation & Anticipated challenges: 
Ideally, users will be able to search for a recipe in the home section via the search bar. This will then take them to the recipe results section. 
- I am not sure how difficult this will be... Perhaps it might be easier to simply guide users to all recipes however I want to give them a sense of agency in picking what recipes to cook and I want to figure out how to filter recipes. 
- I want users to also be able to go to the diary section from the results page (i.e add a recipe to their diary straight away from the recipe cards in the recipe resuls section).
- Ideally, I also want users to access the recipe results section via the search bar and not a button at a top. Perhaps the button at the top could lead them to all recipes but I want to guide users to recipes based off their filters or key words that they searched. 
- Issue: for some reason, my diary section kept appearing below the home section on my Live Server, I asked chatbot for help and it added a section of code in my HTML however I don't quite understand it.
